 ## Description 
 - The project was intended (and assumably, succeeded?) to be a README generator -- that will be 
used in future projects, despite my love for hand-written readmes.
 
 ## Usage
 - For this product, the intent and delivery of reponses, should be followed via 
the Prompts provided (aka the promptUser functions)
 
 ## Credits
 - N/A, no guides were used. I'd like to give a big shoutout to Lindsay, Kristen, and Kristina for our little study-groups!! Y'all are the biggest help and motivators.
